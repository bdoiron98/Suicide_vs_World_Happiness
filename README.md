# Suicide_vs_World_Happiness

# Question
**Does the World Happiness Report have any correlation to country suicide rates?**

Using two data sets, Suicides Per 100,000 and 2015/2016 World Happiness Report, we will look to see if there is a connection between the "happiest" countries and amount of suicides. The World Happiness report uses economic and social development to determine happiness rank. The report negates the fact there is more to happiness than policy and economic well-being. With the help of data collected by the World Health Organization, a more in-depth analysis can be made about happiness per country.


# Conclusion 

Using the World Happiness Report and the suicides per 100000 from the World Health Organization it is determined that Happiness Rank and Suicides have no correlation. For example the United States is ranked 14th but have 21.1 suicides per 100000 for males when the average is 14.7.
